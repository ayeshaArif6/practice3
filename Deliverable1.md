# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Teacher course planning tool

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Timothy Apsey

**Git Master**: Maryan Zinko

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Understanding the main features of Memoranda, starting to adapt it to our topic, and fixing obvious bugs.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  Number: 17

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?
14
**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

>  With these US we felt like this would give the team a greate oppurtunity to review most of the code while not getting to heavy with changing and altering it. Allowing us to allign with out sprint goal and achieving minor updates to the code. We can get them done since it sould be basic surface level stuff to slightly more intensive issues that shouldnt take too long to implement during the sprint.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> Since most of the US gave us an oppurtunity to explore the code, go to the different folders and files of the application, allowing us to fix minor bugs in the code and getting a better feel for the code.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did NOT attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough, Sprint 2,3) | GitHub Actions info (does the master pass, Sprint 3) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
| 1/23  | null  | everyone still getting used to things   |   |  |  |
|  1/25 |  null | US are starting to get pushed into dev and no major road blocks  |   |  |  |
|  1/27 | null  | Very good, lots of pulls went through into dev.  |   |  |  |



## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Our value that was created with this sprint is while adding minor bug fixes and light things to the code base, the team now has a understanding of the code base and an overview of the code which then allows the team to be more effective in future sprints.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

>We thought the work was adequete for the first sprint and alligned well with our sprint goal with the amount of work we had put in.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We would say we did meet the customers expectations since we did get obvious things done like changing the language of the ui to everything being english, so we did things that from day one the customer can appreciate and see.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we met our spring goal because, we did fix obvious bugs, to find the bugs we needed to go through alot of the files which then allowed to understand the main features of the memoranda by playing with the code. Now with this better understanding of the memoranda we are now able to better adapt it to our topic.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

>  no there was only one that was not complete.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> he US did not allign with our sprint goal and was a little too early to be incorporated into our workflow along with it being a bit too damanding in what was required to be done at out current stage.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Yes, Due to the nature of the sprint one, the quantitative work was not able to be seen until the final moments of the deadline however it would be unfair to not consider the fact that during the first part of the sprint there was a lot of neccessary time needed to start a foundation for not only this sprint but for future sprints, in regards of understanding what is being required from us and how to properly and accuratly exceute to make sure that once the quantitative work comes out it comes out proper. so in that sense the team did work at a consistent rate of speed.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, we delivered busines value by making sure that everything was done in english, updated the icons to a more modern look, and fixed bug issues that could help the stablity of the application,

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> Yes, tasks were moved whenever they were at the next stages of the process, work was done consistently considering everything else that needed to be in effect.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> Yes the team thinks the things that could be done better is starting to implement more demandning US to test our understanding of the application and challenge our understaning even further to then confirm our beliefs.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Everything is looking good and are looking forward to the future sprints. Excited to push ourselves to gain a better understanding and to really get a good feeling oh how things work.

**Starting in Sprint 2**
Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyse in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving. 

> Your Answer

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

Copy the section for each team member and then everyone adds their individual contributions. 

#### Team member <Maryan Zinko> -- replace <A> with your name:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
In life there is always room for improvement but for the first sprint I think there was adequete work done on my part but I will be always pushing myself for more.

 **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
 Yes, I think I put in enough work and displayed consistency during this sprint. I will try to do even better and polish my work and my skills for the project in future sprints.
